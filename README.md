intro:
When you apply for a job you need to show the hiring manager what skills you have and at the same time let them know more about yourself. Traditionally, this is done using a printed CV, and more recently, people use online platforms like LinkedIn to showcase their skills and experience. However, you now have the skills to create a personalised and modern version: a resume website.
